            <h1 style="color: red;"> Unexepted Accident Detection inside the Tunnel</h1>

            <br>

            <p>Object Detection and Tracking System (ODTS) in combination with a well-known deep learning network,
                Faster Regional Convolution Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), for Object Detection and Conventional Object
                Tracking algorithm will be introduced and applied for automatic detection and monitoring of unexpected
                events on CCTVs in tunnels, which are likely to (1) Wrong-Way Driving (WWD), (2) Stop, (3) Person out of
                vehicle in tunnel (4) Fire. <br> <br> ODTS accepts a video frame in time as an input to obtain Bounding Box (BBox)
                results by Object Detection and compares the BBoxs of the current and previous video frames to assign a
                unique ID number to each moving and detected object. This system makes it possible to track a moving
                object in time, which is not usual to be achieved in conventional object detection frameworks. A deep
                learning model in ODTS was trained with a dataset of event images in tunnels to Average Precision (AP)
                values of 0.8479, 0.7161 and 0.9085 for target objects: Car, Person, and Fire, respectively. Then, based
                on trained deep learning model, the ODTS based Tunnel CCTV Accident Detection System was tested using
                four accident videos which including each accident. As a result, the system can detect all accidents
                within 10 seconds. The more important point is that the detection capacity of ODTS could be enhanced
                automatically without any changes in the program codes as the training dataset becomes rich.</p>
